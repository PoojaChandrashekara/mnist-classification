# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates building, training, and evaluating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using Keras.

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: This file provides general information about the project.
- `mnist_classification.py`: Contains the Python code for building and training the model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.
- (Optional) `data`: Directory to store the MNIST dataset (if not downloaded automatically).
- (Optional) `models`: Directory to store saved model weights.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
